## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- [#128](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/pull/128) [`41155b0`](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/commit/41155b02b38961c2ea158ab1e6f2b8fbe7a36d9e) Thanks [@dbanksdesign](https://github.com/dbanksdesign)! - Fix `runTypestylesBuild` dropping CSS from a component reached only through a plain bare import (`import './some-lib';`, no binding at all) of a package marked `"sideEffects": false`. This is a separate esbuild behavior from the tree-shaking-of-declarations bug fixed previously (`treeShaking: false`, in the prior patch) — it happens earlier, driven directly by the `sideEffects` / `@__PURE__` annotations, and drops the import before the module is ever considered for bundling, regardless of the `treeShaking` setting. A real extraction entry is exactly this shape: several side-effect-only imports, any one of which may point at a (correctly) tree-shakeable component library. The extraction bundle now also sets `ignoreAnnotations: true` so no import in the extraction graph is dropped based on these annotations.

### Patch Changes

- [#126](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/pull/126) [`de79e3a`](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/commit/de79e3a17eb1765b5a1349bf08b7b7f7ca486838) Thanks [@dbanksdesign](https://github.com/dbanksdesign)! - Fix `runTypestylesBuild` dropping CSS from components reached only through an unread namespace/barrel import. Style registration calls (`styles.component`, `styles.class`, `createTypeStyles`) are side-effect-only — the CSS they register is the point, independent of whether the returned classname function is ever read. esbuild's default tree shaking didn't know that, so a consumer's extraction entry that imports a tree-shakeable component library via `import * as lib from '...'` (never destructuring/reading a named export) could have that library's internal registration calls silently eliminated as "unused," especially for libraries marked `"sideEffects": false`. The extraction bundle now sets `treeShaking: false` so every registration in the graph survives, matching real runtime behavior.

### Minor Changes

- [#97](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/pull/97) [`468375c`](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/commit/468375cbf9524059e6749f6a48513495c41a9376) Thanks [@dbanksdesign](https://github.com/dbanksdesign)! - Add shared convention entry discovery across Rollup, esbuild, and webpack plugins; ship `@typestyles/esbuild` and `@typestyles/webpack`; extend discovery to `.js` entry files; add Vue, Svelte, esbuild, and Parcel examples with build verification.

- [#100](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/pull/100) [`f5b9c6d`](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/commit/f5b9c6d079a638e5d62c21746f12b0a2e53e29a2) Thanks [@dbanksdesign](https://github.com/dbanksdesign)! - Per-route critical CSS for Next.js App Router (P2.15): `buildTypestylesForNext` emits route-scoped stylesheets and manifest v2 with a `routes` map; `getRouteCss` reads them at request time instead of the full `getRegisteredCss()` buffer.

### Patch Changes

- [#98](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/pull/98) [`e17b8a0`](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/commit/e17b8a06d0a54ed3f6f0907fe84beb3d4fd03989) Thanks [@dbanksdesign](https://github.com/dbanksdesign)! - Add npm landing-page READMEs for every published package, an examples index with contributor guidance, and doc-to-example cross-links (P2.13).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#75](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/pull/75) [`8bf64b0`](https://github.com/type-styles/typestyles/commit/8bf64b0f3f7da26a4dd91ce4ef5fcca5fea0cb4b) Thanks [@dbanksdesign](https://github.com/dbanksdesign)! - Add shared convention entry discovery: `discoverDefaultExtractModules` and `DEFAULT_EXTRACT_MODULE_CANDIDATES` (including `styles/typestyles-entry.ts` and `styles/typestyles.ts` after the `src/…` paths).

  **@typestyles/vite** re-exports these from `@typestyles/build-runner` and resolves optional `extract.modules` using the same list.

  **@typestyles/next** depends on `@typestyles/build-runner`, aligns `buildTypestylesForNext` with that discovery, defaults `cssOutFile` to `app/typestyles.css` and manifest output unless overridden, adds `withTypestyles` for production config when a convention file exists, and re-exports the discovery helpers.

  `withTypestyles` now passes `root` through to extraction internals so webpack resolution uses the same project root as convention discovery.

  **Breaking (Next):** `BuildTypestylesForNextOptions` no longer requires `modules` or `cssOutFile`; pass them explicitly when you need non-default behavior.

Re-export from `@typestyles/next/build` and document on the zero-runtime page.
