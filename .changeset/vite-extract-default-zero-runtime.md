**@typestyles/vite:** When `extract.modules` is set and `mode` is omitted, default `mode` is now `'build'`: `vite dev` keeps runtime injection and HMR; `vite build` emits the CSS asset and disables client injection (same as explicit `mode: 'build'`). Pass `mode: 'runtime'` to keep the previous “extract config present but runtime-only” behavior. Vitest: plugin tests extended; runtime/build parity moved to `build-parity.test.ts` with `skipIf` when `build-runner` dist is missing.

**@typestyles/next:** README documents applying `withTypestylesExtract` only in production so development keeps client runtime injection.

Docs (`vite-plugin`, `zero-runtime`, `getting-started`) and `roadmap.md` describe dev-runtime / prod-extraction; `examples/vite-app`, `examples/typewind`, and `examples/next-app` (`next.config.mjs`) follow the recommended wiring.
